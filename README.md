# Script-to-automatically-remove-all-LinkedIn-connections

1. Login to your LinkedIn profile
2. Visit https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/invite-connect/connections/
3. Open your Browser's DevTools (F12 in Chrome)
4. Paste the script into the console and hit Enter
5. Watch the script removing your connectiond 1 by 1
6. It might stop working after a bunch of removed connections, 
   simply paste and hit enter again.
   Good enough for me and still way better than doing it manually :)
